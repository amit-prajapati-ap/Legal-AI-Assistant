    However, based on the Motor Vehicles Act, Indian Penal Code, and allied legislation, you may still have legal remedies depending on your circumstances. Our AI assistant is designed to provide preliminary insights, not legal advice.

    **General Legal Guidelines:**
    - Collect all relevant facts, documents, and witness details
    - Understand applicable laws (e.g., CrPC, IPC, CPC, IT Act, etc.)
    - Avoid making decisions without clarity on jurisdiction and timelines

    **Next Steps:**
    - Consult a qualified lawyer with your documentation
    - You can file RTIs, police complaints, FIRs, or civil suits based on the issue
    - For faster help, try rephrasing your query with specific terms (e.g., "tenant eviction", "cyber fraud", "anticipatory bail")`,
